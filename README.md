# TINF21C_Modelling_Wizard_Improvements
The so-called Modeling Wizard is an application that was developed in a number of predecessor projects.
A device model can be created via a GUI. The addition of device interfaces (e.g. physical ports) and file attachments is possible. 
The creation of a model can be done manually or by importing existing descriptions in different file formats (AMLX, AML, EDZ, IODD, GSD).
The primary goal of this project is to improve the GUI after a thorough test phase and usability analysis as well as identifing and correcting errors.
