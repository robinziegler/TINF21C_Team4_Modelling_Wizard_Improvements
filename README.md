This project is worked on by students of the DHBW Stuttgart in the context of the lecture "Software Engineering" in the third and fourth semester. The project is supervised by Markus Rentschler and Christian Holder.

The current state of development can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/robinziegler/TINF21C_Team4_Modelling_Wizard_Improvements/releases/tag/1.0.0). The Installation Guide can be found below at the links.

___

The Modelling Wizard is an application that was developed in a number of [previous projects](#old-project-statuses).
A device model can be created via a GUI. The addition 
of device interfaces (e.g. physical ports) and file attachments is possible. The model can be created manually or by reading existing description formats in different file formats (AMLX, AML, EDZ, IODD, GSD). 
The primary goal of this project is to improve the GUI after a thorough test phase and usability analysis. 
The user interface will be improved and errors in the program will be identified and corrected.

**The following subtasks will be mainly worked on:**

1. Test of the existing tool incl. error analysis
2. Usability analysis of the existing GUI, design of a usability concept
3. Design and implementation of an improved GUI based on a usability concept
4. Bug fixing and code refactoring
5. Testing of the functionalities
6. Creation of a detailed user documentation
